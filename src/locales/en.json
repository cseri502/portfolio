        "content": "I have always been attracted to technology and the freedom to create, so development has become my main focus. Whether it's backend systems, databases or full applications, I always strive to create clean, efficient and scalable solutions.\n\nI am currently studying Computer Science at University of Debrecen to further my knowledge in software development. Previously, I obtained a qualification in IT systems management at DSZC Mechwart, where I also gained insight into the world of networking and server management. This background allows me to think not only at the code level, but also to focus on the efficient operation of the infrastructure and systems.\n\nI am motivated by continuous development and new challenges, so I am always looking for projects where creativity, precision and deep technical knowledge are required. If you'd like to collaborate, feel free to contact me!",
